# TeleporterDash: Bug Report

## Effect Engine Issues

### Missing PIXI Filter Checks

* Filter creation doesn't have robust fallbacks if PIXI filters aren't available
  * Could cause silent failures in visual effects

### Particle System Memory Management

* Particle cleanup might be incomplete, potentially causing memory leaks over time

## Matrix Parser Issues

### Lack of Input Validation

* Some validation paths don't throw errors for invalid input values
  * Could lead to corrupted game objects

## Game Test HTML Issues

### Missing Error Handling in Game Loop

* No proper error handling in the game loop if physics or render updates fail
  * Could cause the entire game to freeze without any feedback to the user

## Cross-Module Integration Issues

### Circular Dependencies Risk

* Multiple modules import from each other creating potential circular dependency risks
  * For example, audioManager and achievementManager have circular references

### Inconsistent Module Pattern Usage

* Some modules use class exports (AudioManager), others use object literals (StorageManager)
  * This inconsistency makes integration between modules more error-prone

## Missing Mobile/Touch Support (!)

* While the CSS has touch-action: manipulation, there's no actual touch event handlers
  * Game would be unplayable on mobile devices

## Optimization Issues

* Inefficient Matrix Parsing
  * Each cell is processed individually and causes redundant operations
  * No caching mechanism for previously parsed matrices

## Visual Effects Bugs: (!)

* Particles aren't working and most other effects make the objects appear weird

## Pausing in GameTest

* pausing should pause the game and animation and audio

Fix modifiers
