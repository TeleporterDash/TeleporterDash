# TeleporterDash: Bug Report
## Audio Manager Issues
### Race Condition in isMusicPlaying Flag
* In audioManager.js, there's a potential race condition with the isMusicPlaying flag
  - If a playback error occurs, the flag might not be properly reset, potentially blocking future audio playback
* Undefined SettingsManager Reference
  - In toggleMute() and other methods, there's a check for typeof SettingsManager !== 'undefined' without verifying SettingsManager.current exists
  - This could cause "cannot read property of undefined" errors
* Inconsistent Error Handling
  - playDeathSound() doesn't have promise error handling like other similar methods

## Physics Engine Issues
### Input Handling Logic Bug
In handleInput(), there's code for clipper mode inside a classic mode condition:
\`\`\`javascript
if (this.player.mode === 'classic') {
  // Classic mode logic...
  
  // Bug: This should be outside the classic mode check
  if (this.player.mode === 'clipper') {
    // Clipper mode logic that will never execute
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Teleporter Distance Calculation
* Hardcoded as 100 / 32 without accounting for different screen sizes

### Inconsistent Player Reset Logic
* reset() and cleanup() methods have redundant but different logic
  - reset() doesn't reset the player's score property

## Achievement Manager Issues
### Undefined References
* In unlockAchievement(), popupManager is used without checking if it exists
  - Could cause runtime errors if popup manager isn't initialized first
### Missing Initialization Check
* No verification that audioManager is properly initialized before using it

## Render Engine Issues
### Potential Memory Leaks
* When removing sprites in the clear() method, there's no complete cleanup of all references
### Animation Synchronization
* No error handling if animations are updated before the matrix or sprites are initialized

## Effect Engine Issues
### Missing PIXI Filter Checks
* Filter creation doesn't have robust fallbacks if PIXI filters aren't available
  - Could cause silent failures in visual effects
### Particle System Memory Management
* Particle cleanup might be incomplete, potentially causing memory leaks over time

## Storage Manager Issues
### Inconsistent Promise Handling
* Some methods have incomplete promise handling chains
  - Could lead to unhandled promise rejections

## Teleporter Engine Issues
### Limited Teleportation Logic
* Only checks for teleporters with matching IDs and opposite types
  - No handling for complex teleportation chains or special cases

## Matrix Parser Issues
### Lack of Input Validation
* Some validation paths don't throw errors for invalid input values
  - Could lead to corrupted game objects

## Music Sync Issues
### AudioContext Initialization Timing Bug
* musicSync.js initializes an AudioContext without checking for user interaction
  - This might violate browser autoplay policies and cause audio sync to fail
### Missing Error Handling for Audio Context
* No fallback mechanism if AudioContext creation fails
  - Could silently fail on unsupported browsers

## Popup Manager Issues
### Missing DOM State Verification
* popupManager.js doesn't check if document.body exists before appending popups
  - Could cause errors if used before DOM is fully loaded
### CSS Style Conflicts
* CSS styles are added directly to document.head without checking for duplicates
  - Could cause style duplication in certain scenarios

## Score Manager Issues
### Undefined StorageManager Reference
* scoreManager.js uses StorageManager without importing it or checking if it exists
  - Line 15: await StorageManager.initialize(); with no import statement
  - Will cause runtime errors
### Inconsistent Data Structure
* Uses both Map and object structures for storing scores
  - Line 183 references this.SCORES_KEY which isn't defined anywhere

## Group Manager Issues
### Logical Error in isObjectActive Function
* groupManager.js has a confusing implementation: return !object || object.lock !== 'off';
  - Returns true for null objects, which might cause unexpected behavior

## Sprite Manager Issues
### Memory Leak in Asset Loading
* spriteManager.js doesn't clean up unused sprite textures
  - Continues accumulating textures in PIXI.Assets cache
### SVG Parsing Error Handling
* Attempts to parse empty SVGs without proper validation
  - Could cause XML parsing errors on malformed content

## Game Test HTML Issues
### Incorrect setLogLevel Call
* In gameTest.html, setLogLevel('debug') is called before importing the function
  - This will cause a reference error
* Music restarts instead of pausing
* [Error] TypeError: renderEngine.stopGameLoop is not a function.
  - restartGame() calls renderEngine.stopGameLoop() which doesn't exist
### Missing Error Handling in Game Loop
* No proper error handling in the game loop if physics or render updates fail
  - Could cause the entire game to freeze without any feedback to the user
### Race Condition in startLevel Function
* Audio initialization happens inside the startLevel function but might be too late for sprites that need audio

## Cross-Module Integration Issues
### Circular Dependencies Risk
* Multiple modules import from each other creating potential circular dependency risks
  - For example, audioManager and achievementManager have circular references
### Inconsistent Module Pattern Usage
* Some modules use class exports (AudioManager), others use object literals (StorageManager)
  - This inconsistency makes integration between modules more error-prone

## Missing Mobile/Touch Support
* While the CSS has touch-action: manipulation, there's no actual touch event handlers
  - Game would be unplayable on mobile devices

## Event Listener Memory Leaks
* Event listeners are added but never properly removed when components are cleaned up
  - This can lead to memory leaks, especially with keyboard events

## Missing Responsive Layout Logic
* Fixed canvas size of 512x256 without any responsive scaling
  - Game would appear tiny on high-resolution screens

## Optimization Issues
* Inefficient Matrix Parsing
  - Each cell is processed individually and causes redundant operations
  - No caching mechanism for previously parsed matrices
* Redundant Asset Loading
  - Sprites are loaded every time a level starts instead of being cached globally

## Visual Effects Bugs:  (!)
* Particles aren't working and most other effects make the objects appear weird


## Pausing in GameTest
* pausing should pause the game and animation and audio

## Unlocking 
* unlocking should rerender the matrix but keep the player at the same spot


## Level Complete
* level complete should stop all rendering and fade out audio (after playing level complete sound) and show the level complete screen
